If the victim is infected, the victim computer with "'IP' 'Windows Account Name'" will be added. Then select the victim computer in the "select box" and click "show zombiePC control" to control the victim computer. Then it's over.
```
webhooklinks: webhook links on your personal server to receive logs
path : Path where images, etc. will be saved
file name: Enter the name of the malicious code to be created. (If the file name is other than this, it will not work.)
icon : Enter the malicious code icon file. If not, please leave blank.
```
After entering everything, click the "Make Malware" button to infect the victim with malware using the .exe extension created in the dist path.
### Description of this malware
This malicious code uses one-way unstable encryption communication technique.
This malicious code is a malicious code using Discord.
victimPC -> discord(webhook) -> attacker
This communication structure makes you more secretive.
For example, if you create Discord using a fake email address and use a vpn to log in, you can definitely hide yourself.
But it is not without its drawbacks. Because the victim's computer sends a one-way communication to the offender's computer, the assailant cannot command the victim's computer.
And because it is instantaneous communication, not continuous communication, instantaneous changes cannot be known. The information only comes according to a set tick.
But that's not a more valuable concern than a security threat.
The main features of this malware are that it can get the title of the window being used by the victim computer, get the screen and get the cam. Keylogs are of course also possible
